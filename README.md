# Relative Habitability Project
Some code, figures, and information behind the paper ["Relative Habitability of Exoplanet Systems with Two Giant Planets"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4765B/abstract).

# Introduction

The primary intent of this project was to use a large dataset of simulation results to investigate how the orbits of giant planets within a planetary system affect the potential habitability of an Earth-like companion planet. In conducting this research, I completed close to 12 million individual simulations to create a dataset spanning 10 dimensions. The simulations were run on the high performance computing cluster at the University of Chicago. The entire dataset is [published and available for use](https://zenodo.org/record/6324216#.ZF27pXbMJPY). Here, I document a few examples of the work I completed during this project. For a more comprehensive description and results, please see the paper.

# Understanding the Dataset

# Visualization

Given such a large and multidimensional dataset, a key part of my work was visualizing this data in a way that was understandable without being so simplified as to lose the relevant details.

# Open Access Data

For purposes of validation and continued research, it was important to publish the entire dataset in a machine readable format for anyone else to make use of.
